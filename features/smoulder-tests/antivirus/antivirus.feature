Scenario: Uploading an infected file to a bucket should generate a warning email
  Given I have a randomized file containing the eicar test signature
  When I upload that file to the documents bucket under the key 'functional_tests/we?rd d%r+name‚ù°/bad.csv'
  Then I receive a notification regarding that file within 4 minutes
