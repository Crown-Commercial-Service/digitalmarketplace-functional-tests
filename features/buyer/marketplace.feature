Feature: Buyer user journey through Digital Marketplace

Scenario: User can see the main links on the landing page
  Given I am on the homepage
  Then I see the link to 'Find cloud technology and support'
  And I see the link to 'Buy physical datacentre space for legacy systems'
  And I see the link to 'Find an individual specialist'
  And I see the link to 'Find a team to provide an outcome'
  And I see the link to 'Find user research participants'
  And I see the link to 'Find a user research lab'
  And I see the link to 'View Digital Outcomes and Specialists opportunities'
